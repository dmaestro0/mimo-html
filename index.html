<h1> Jose Medina </h1>
<h2> Currently: Critical-thinker, problem-solver, passionate, lost, soul-searching</h2>
<p> However, I beleive that through this period of soul-searching, lost and so fucking confused, I will find something that I love to do. Something that I can be passionate at. Money does not buy happiness but you can use it to get the things that make you happy. And this here, was a tangent. </p>
